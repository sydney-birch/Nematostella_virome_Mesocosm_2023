# Nematostella_virome_Mesocosm_2023
This repository contains the virome and microbiome work flow for our 2023 Mesocosm study examining how 1) different male and female Nematostella clonal lines and 2) knockout lines of immunity genes, interact with microbes and viruses from a natural, foreign environment (SC estuary).

-   Clonal lines:
      - FL.Male
      - FL.Female
      - NC.Male
      - NC.Female
      - ME.Male
      - ME.Female
- KO Lines
